# configuration.nix

My Nix config files.

This repo is a flake containing my system configurations.

## Systems

Named after semantically relevant Greek mythological figures.

### `hermes`

Workstation laptop, currently a Lenovo T14 (1st generation, AMD).

Named after the god of travel and mobility.

### `theseus`

Powerful workstation desktop, currently a self-built machine ([part list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vsk7LP)), but the name has been used for other sets of parts in the past.

The name was inspired by the ship of Theseus, since the computer was rebuilt so many times.

### `heracles`

Large virtual server (Oracle VM.Standard.A1 ARM machine) that runs a collection of miscellaneous services, including my Discord bot.

Migrated from `talos`, which was a VM provided by a now-defunct service called Fosshost.

Named after the accomplished hero who performed many different deeds.

### `iris`

Mail server (Google e2-micro VM) using simple-nixos-mailserver.

Named after an obscure goddess of messaging and rainbows.

### `angelia`

Formerly a Matrix server. Currently idle. Will eventually be a Matrix server again, probably. (formerly `neo`)

Named after the daughter of Hermes, who is a personification of the concept of a message (the name also means "message" in ancient Greek).

### `harpokrates`

WIP image for an air-gapped Certificate Authority machine and key store.

Named after the god of secrets and silence.

### `hephaistos`

WIP build server (Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny M90q gen 3). Might eventually become a file server/Plex host.

Named after the god of crafts, smithing and the forge.

### `arachne`

Web server, currently an Oracle Cloud image (VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro). (formerly `leonardo`)

Named after a figure in a myth about a spider (the name also means "spider").
